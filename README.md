## Installation

### Dependence

Requires `fzf`, `sk` or your favorite fuzzy finder, but recommended one is `fzf` or `sk` to use full features.

- [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [lotabout/skim](https://https://github.com/lotabout/skim)

If `fzf` or `sk` is not installed, install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S fzf
# or
sudo pacman -S sk
```

If you want to use other fuzzy finder, see **FZPAC_FINDER** section in Configuration.

### Optional

#### AUR Helper

If you have the following AUR helpers installed, `fzpac` will use that command in preference to `pacman` .

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru">Morganamilo/paru</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay">Jguer/yay</a></li>
</ul>

#### Tab Completion on the Shells

##### bash

To use Tab completion with bash, install the `bash-completion` package.

```bash
sudo pacman -S bash-completion
```

then, add the following contents to your `~/.bashrc` .

```bash
_set_completion() {
    local bash_completion
    bash_completion='/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion'
    [ -f "${bash_completion}" ] && source "${bash_completion}"
}

_set_completion
```

##### fish

Complete functions are built into `fish` so you don't need to install any additional packages.

##### zsh

To use Tab completion with zsh, requires `zsh-completions` package.

```zsh
sudo pacman -S zsh-completions
```

then, append this commands on your `.zshrc` to activate completion.

```.zshrc
autoload -U compinit
compinit -u
```

### Install with PKGBUILD (Recommend)

Run below if you want to install the latest stable version with `PKGBUILD` .
After a successful installation, you can manage `fzpac` as an Arch Linux package.

```bash
# install base-devel package
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
# cd to some empty directory to build package
cd "$(mktemp -d)"
# download PKGBUILD file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheepla/fzpac/main/aur/PKGBUILD
# build package and install
makepkg -si
```

### Install from the latest commit

Run below if you want to install the latest commit version.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheepla/fzpac
cd fzpac
sudo make install
```

## Configurations

### FZPAC_PACMAN

To change the AUR helper command to use, run fzpac with the value of the `"${FZPAC_PACMAN}"` variable set.

This value is a colon-separated list like a `"${PATH}"` variable, elements are but commands not directories. fzpac tries to use each of the commands in `"${FZPAC_PACMAN}"` in turn as a pacman command to find packages. So fallback to following commands if the preceding one isn't found.

If no `"${FZPAC_PACMAN}"` is set or empty, fzpac assumes the value is `paru:yay:pacman`.

Note that fzpac assumes commands in `"${FZPAC_PACMAN}"` supports pacman compatible arguments. So maybe fzpac doesn't work as expected if the commands don't support them.

```bash
# Elements are command name or path.
FZPAC_PACMAN="aur-helper1:/path/to/aur-helper2:..." fzpac ...

# Precede your favorite AUR helper if you want to give priority to it.
FZPAC_FINDER="yay:paru:..." fzpac ...
```

To always use this setting, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or other shell rc file

```bash
export FZPAC_PACMAN="aur-helper1:/path/to/aur-helper2:..."
```

### FZPAC_FINDER

Almost the same as `"${FZPAC_PACMAN}"`, but this is to config the fuzzy finder which is used in fzpac.

If no `"${FZPAC_FINDER}"` is set or empty, fzpac assumes the value is `fzf:sk:peco:gof:fzy` .
