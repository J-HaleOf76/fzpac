## Installation

### Dependence

Requires `fzf`.

<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">junegunn/fzf</a>

If `fzf` is not installed, install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S fzf
```

### Optional

#### AUR Helper

If you have the following AUR helpers installed, `fzpac` will use that command in preference to `pacman` .

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru">Morganamilo/paru</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay">Jguer/yay</a></li>
</ul>

#### Tab Completion on the Shells

##### bash

To use Tab completion with bash, install the `bash-completion` package.

```bash
sudo pacman -S bash-completion
```

then, add the following contents to your `~/.bashrc` .

```bash
_set_completion() {
    local bash_completion
    bash_completion='/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion'
    [ -f "${bash_completion}" ] && source "${bash_completion}"
}

_set_completion
```

##### fish

Complete functions are built into `fish` so you don't need to install any additional packages.

##### zsh

To use Tab completion with zsh, requires `zsh-completions` package.

```zsh
sudo pacman -S zsh-completions
```

then, activate zsh completions on your `.zshrc`.

```.zshrc
autoload -U compinit
compinit -u
```
